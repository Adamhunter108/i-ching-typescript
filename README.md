🤔 What is the I Ching
</summary>
The I Ching, usually translated to Book of Changes, dates back to 1,000 BC. This several thousand year old book is regarded as a foundational text of eastern wisdom and philosophy. Originally a divination manual, the I Ching is meant to provide insight and guidance for moral decision making. An I Ching reading comes in the form of a Hexagram which consists of six lines which are either broken (yin) or unbroken (yang).

🔮 How to consult the I Ching
</summary> 
Back in the day, people would throw yarrow stalks to calculate and construct their Hexagrams. Tossing coins, usually three at a time, is a more modern and convenient method. Those analog methods require calculations and often involve interpreting changing lines.<br>   
To use this app, all you need to do is press the Divinate button. We recommend doing only one reading a day and sitting with the result. Each Hexagram is unique and has a number. Feel free to google your Hexagram number to read more about it.

<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
